    <li>Add the ground meat to the skillet and cook until browned. Drain excess fat if necessary.</li>
    <li>Pour tomato sauce into the skillet with the cooked meat. Stir in Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, combine ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, beaten eggs, and a pinch of salt. Mix well to create a creamy filling.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer of pasta sheets on top, covering the sauce.</li>
    <li>Spoon half of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the pasta sheets.</li>
    <li>Add another layer of pasta sheets, followed by a generous amount of the meat sauce. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
    <li>Repeat the layers with the remaining ingredients, finishing with a layer of pasta sheets and a final sprinkle of mozzarella cheese.</li>
